# Dismod-Website

## Project information

```
This is to showcase the code behind my website, except where information is perceived to be 'secret'. Mainly using it as remote storage for the codebase, and also to help others who may feel they would like a reference point for their own education or project purposes.

Feel free to contribute to the codebase if you discover any bugs/issues.

## License

```
This is publicly open on github for users to freely use to help set-up their projects, however I do not authorise the use of any images, names, branding etc found within the files, do change these if you pull the code to use in your own projects. I do ask, that you link back to this repo for credit where necessary. I presume if you are to pull this code, that you are adept enough to know what you are doing, as such, I do not accept any liability for any misuse, damages, loss of information or anything else that may go wrong, nor for any modifications made to the code outside of my control.
